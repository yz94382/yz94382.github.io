	  <H3>What is Hanfu?</h3>
	  <P><B>Han Chinese clothing, or Hanfu</B> (汉服, literally "Clothing of the Han people") refers
	  to the traditional clothing of the Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group of China. 
	  Hanfu (or Hanfu Clothing, Hanfu Clothes) was regarded by Han Chinese as a very important 
	  part of their culture. The wearing of appropriate styles of Hanfu was an important part 
	  of courteous refined behaviour. <sup>Confucius</sup> considered Hanfu a very important part of Chinese 
	  ceremony and ritual and many of his quotations contain references to Hanfu.It's the significant 
	  cultural symbol of Chinese civilization, and it has had a <sub>long history</sub> for nearly 4000 years since 
	  China originally began.   
	  </P>

	  <div style="text-align:left">
	  <H3>What is the style of Hanfu?</h3>
	  <P>A whole set of the Han Chinese <B>Garment</B> has <I>three layers</I>: an underwear, an inner garment and 
	  an overcoat. The three layers embrace ten elements: collar, hem, sleeve, lapel, belt and so on. 
	  And accessories such as socks, shawl and jade belt are used on the Hanfu. <br>Chinese civilization, 
	  also called <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">"Hua-Xia" ("Hwa-Shia")</span>. "Hua"("Hwa") means the beauty of the dress & decoration which 
	  is Hanfu clothing; "Xia"("Shia") is the grandeur of rites and social conduct. <br> Many East Asian national
	  costumes, such as the Japanese Kimono, the Korean Hanbok still share the basic style with Hanfu, 
	  as historically these nations were largely influenced by (Han) Chinese culture.

	  <pre>
	  Nowadays, our Chinese youth started the "Chinese Renaissance"
	  We hope to evoke the awearness of re-knowing and protecting the real Chinese.
	  Hanfu is one of the most important parts of Chinese traditiona.
	  I want to introducte Hanfu to more people.
	  My favorite clothes is <del>Qipao</del> <ins>Hanfu</ins>!
